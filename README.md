NN-MovieNews
==========

This is to create a content page where you can have all the latest movies news and gossip. This will read the RSS Feeds from some popular movie web sites. Enjoy

Please note that I am NOT an Expert Coder. I cobbled this together from different code snippets. I am sure there are better and more efficient ways to do this. Each of the Tabs loads only when clicked. This saves page load time. 

<b>I hope this inspires other people to create some other cool relevant content pages for nn+</b>
